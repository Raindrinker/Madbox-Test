# Madbox-Test

### The time it took you to perform the exercise

	5 straight hours, from 15:00 to 20:00 18/01/2020

### The parts that were difficult for you and why

	- I'm not too used to both Unity and 3D right now (I've been doing 2D Godot games lately) so I had some issues managing Quaternions, 
3D models & animations, and I was constantly writing GDScript syntax and having to fix it.
	- Paths were a big problem, and considering the limited time I went with a very inelegant approach.
	- Level design felt very bland as I was just copying some of the obstacles in the original game, which has a lot of hitbox-guessing that doesn't feel too good.

### The parts you think you could do better and how

	- Paths. They should be automated so you don't have to match the road models and the players' path by hand, and from that making a sort of
either level editor or randomization shouldn't be too hard. Paths were a must for the game and I feel its hard to solve without losing too much time.
	- Theres a ton of possible polish in the animations, the death, and other cool feedback and juice on the losses and victories.
	- Wanted to have UI showing player's and enemies' progress, but ran out of time
	- had zero time for audio apart from putting or a classic Incompetech track
	- The bot just runs. I might have been able to do some raycasting behavior, but I dont think it would have worked well.
	- Code organization is pretty jam-like, and project organisation is pretty much throwing all the stuff together in a folder. 
Would need a cleanup if theproject were to be continued.
	
### What you would do if you could go a step further on this game

	- Give it a lot of juice and visual feedback.
	- Try to design levels that have as little hitbox-guessing as possible
	- Give the characters/game some unique theme/personality, so it's not a forgettable generic person running game
	- Build some meta level of progression (unlocks, levels, infinite mode) to encourage continued play, with a proper menu.
	- Original game is online, which I guess works nice, but I'm not sure playing vs actual players adds too much over
playing agains decent bots. Maybe even the original game simulates multiplayer sometimes, it felt like.

### What did you think
### Any comment you may have

	- I really hoped to make something truly spectacular but having a full game as a reference instead of a theme and being on an engine
	I'm a bit rusty on (and havign to work with free assets) right now held me back a bit.
	- It has been a cool excercise and I ejoyed it quite a bit
	- The original game might have been popular but feels very barebones and forgettable to me, with a lot of potential to be better.
	- I feel like the game has too many "tech" elements that are a must (Curved path with progress, multiple players, obstacle hitboxes) that I had no time
to actually design gameplay or test and decide on a few obstacle possibilities, gameplay was pretty much designed for me from the reference and I had to go with the first 
obstacles that I could replicate fast.
	- I'm not too proud of the result. I do hope my gamejam portfolio tips the scales, and I'm sure if I start working in Unity I'll pick up speed super fast.
